# BPMN-Model-Analysis
This tool provides functionalities to analyze BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) models in XPDL (XML Process Definition Language) format. It allows users to parse BPMN elements, assign random execution times to tasks, and calculate the total cycle time of processes.

Features
Parse XPDL Files: Count various BPMN elements such as events, activities, gateways, artifacts, and swimlanes.
Assign Random Execution Times: Add random execution times to task elements in the BPMN model.
Calculate Cycle Time: Calculate the total cycle time based on the execution times of tasks.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
A text editor or IDE for C++ development.
